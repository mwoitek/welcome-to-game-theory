* Problem 1

*Answer:* 3\\

First, consider the best option for Player 1 for each strategy of Player 2:
- Player 2 chooses X: Player 1 chooses C;
- Player 2 chooses Y: Player 1 chooses B;
- Player 2 chooses Z: Player 1 chooses A or C.
Next, consider the best option for Player 2 for each strategy of Player 1:
- Player 1 chooses A: Player 2 chooses X or Z;
- Player 1 chooses B: Player 2 chooses Y;
- Player 1 chooses C: Player 2 chooses X.
Therefore, there are *3 Nash equilibria*:
- Player 1 chooses A and Player 2 chooses Z;
- Player 1 chooses B and Player 2 chooses Y;
- Player 1 chooses C and Player 2 chooses X.

* Problem 2

*Answer:* Belief disagreement may lead to non-Nash outcomes, and its realization
is unpredictable.

* Problem 3

*Answer:* In a Nash equilibrium, both players choose C.\\

First, consider the best option for Player 1 for each strategy of Player 2:
- Player 2 chooses A: Player 1 chooses C;
- Player 2 chooses B: Player 1 chooses C;
- Player 2 chooses C: Player 1 chooses C.
*The best strategy for Player 1 is always C*.\\
Next, consider the best option for Player 2 for each strategy of Player 1:
- Player 1 chooses A: Player 2 chooses C;
- Player 1 chooses B: Player 2 chooses C;
- Player 1 chooses C: Player 2 chooses C.
*The best strategy for Player 2 is always C*. Therefore, *a Nash equilibrium DOES
exist*, and it corresponds to the situation where *both players choose C*.

* Problem 4

*Answer:* This game is similar to the prisoner's dilemma in that it has a better
outcome than Nash equilibrium for all players.\\

If both players chose strategy B, that would be better for both of them.

* Problem 5

*Answer:*
- Version 1: To play a game many times and have better and better beliefs
  against others' behavior.
- Version 2:
  + There can be many Nash equilibria in a game.
  + The /de facto/ standard of a new technology may not be efficient.
  + A game might have good and bad Nash equilibria (the former are better than
    the latter for everyone).

* Problem 6

*Answer:* The prisoner's dilemma, because defection is best for both players and
they do not consider that mutual cooperation can be attained.

* Problem 7

*Answer:*
- Version 1: Agreement is fulfilled without imposing penalty or reward.
- Version 2: There is no guarantee that such an adjustment process always
  converges to a Nash equilibrium.
