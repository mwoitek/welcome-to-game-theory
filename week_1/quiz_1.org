* Problem 1

*Answer:* What is best for you depends on what others do.

* Problem 2

*Answer:* B, D and F
- (B) Players
- (D) Strategies
- (F) Payoffs

* Problem 3

*Answer:* If we just assume that each player maximizes his/her payoff, we fail
to pin down how each one anticipates the other players' behaviors.

* Problem 4

*Answer:* You choose the best available option.

* Problem 5

*Answer:*
- Players are making mutual best replies.
- No players can increase their payoffs by deviating by themselves.

* Problem 6

*Answer:* 75\\

In the first case (before the construction of the bypass), the Nash equilibrium
corresponds to the following situation:
- 25 drivers choose the road of length 350;
- 125 drivers choose the road of length 250.
Then the traveling time for both roads is the same: \( 350+25=250+125=375 \).\\
In the second case (after the construction of the bypass), the Nash equilibrium
corresponds to the following situation:
- no driver chooses the road of length 350;
- 50 drivers choose the road of length 250;
- 100 drivers choose the road of length 200.
Then the traveling time becomes \( 50+250=100+200=300 \). This means the
traveling time goes from 375 to 300. Therefore, this time decreased by 75.

* Problem 7

*Answer:* He found a unified solution concept that can be applied to a wide
range of games.
